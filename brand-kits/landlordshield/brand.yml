# 3. BRAND VOICE AND TONE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
voice:
  summary: >-
    Landlord Shield sounds like a knowledgeable compliance expert who speaks
    plainly: authoritative without being legalistic, clear without being
    condescending, and protective without being paternalistic. We translate
    complex legislation into simple actions.

  traits:
    - adjective: Authoritative
      description: >-
        We know UK property legislation inside out. We speak with the
        confidence that comes from specialism in the Renters' Rights Act
        and broader landlord regulation.
      do: "Your Section 21 notice deadline is 14 March. We have generated the correct form."
      dont: "You might want to check if your notice is still valid. Things may have changed."

    - adjective: Clear
      description: >-
        We replace legal jargon with plain language. Every sentence should
        be understandable on first read, even when explaining complex
        regulation.
      do: "The Renters' Rights Act requires you to register with the new ombudsman by June. We will remind you."
      dont: "Pursuant to the provisions set forth in the Act, registration obligations may apply to qualifying landlords."

    - adjective: Protective
      description: >-
        We frame every feature through the lens of what it shields the
        landlord from: penalties, missed deadlines, non-compliance risk.
        Benefits over features.
      do: "Shield yourself from penalties with automated compliance tracking."
      dont: "Our platform offers a compliance tracking feature for properties."

    - adjective: Direct
      description: >-
        We get to the point. Short sentences. Active voice. No filler
        paragraphs. Landlords are busy; respect their time.
      do: "Track every deadline. Generate every notice. Stay compliant."
      dont: "Why not take a few minutes to explore our comprehensive suite of compliance management tools?"

    - adjective: Human
      description: >-
        We acknowledge that keeping up with changing legislation is
        stressful and that landlords are real people with real concerns
        about getting it right. We never sound robotic or bureaucratic.
      do: "New regulation can feel overwhelming. That is exactly why we built this."
      dont: "Our compliance management solution is available for your regulatory needs."

  tone_modifiers:
    marketing:
      energy: high
      formality: low
      humor: subtle
      description: >-
        Bold, punchy, benefit-led. Short copy. Strong CTAs. Lead with the
        compliance pain point and resolve it immediately.
      example: "The Renters' Rights Act changes everything. Landlord Shield keeps you compliant. Start free."
    social:
      energy: high
      formality: low
      humor: moderate
      description: >-
        Conversational, friendly, community-minded. Can be witty about
        bureaucracy but never flippant about real compliance risk.
      example: "New legislation dropped and your to-do list just tripled. Or you could let Landlord Shield handle it."
    support:
      energy: calm
      formality: medium
      humor: none
      description: >-
        Empathetic, patient, solution-oriented. Acknowledge the confusion
        before offering the fix. Compliance questions deserve clear answers.
      example: "I understand this deadline is confusing. Let me walk you through exactly what you need to do and by when."
    formal:
      energy: low
      formality: high
      humor: none
      description: >-
        Legal guidance documents, regulatory summaries, partnership
        correspondence. Precise but still accessible.
      example: "Under the Renters' Rights Act 2025, landlords are required to register with the approved ombudsman scheme within the prescribed timeframe."
